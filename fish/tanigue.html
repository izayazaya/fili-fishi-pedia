            The Tanigue fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It thrives in warm, tropical waters and is commonly found near coral reefs, drop-offs, and coastal areas.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Tanigue fish is highly valued for its firm, meaty flesh and distinctive flavor. It is often used in Filipino cuisine for grilling, baking, or making dishes like sinigang (sour soup), kilawin (raw fish marinated in
            vinegar), or paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar). Tanigue is also popular in sushi and sashimi preparations. It is sold fresh in local markets, but it is also preserved by salting, smoking, or drying. Due to its rich taste and versatility in
            cooking, it has strong demand both domestically and internationally. The fish supports the livelihoods of local fishermen, particularly in coastal communities, and is a significant part of the Philippine seafood industry. While not as
            commercially important as tuna, Tanigue remains a highly sought-after fish in both the local market and export trade.
