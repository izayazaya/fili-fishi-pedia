            Talangka is a sought-after seafood in the Philippines due to its delicious, rich meat, which is often harvested from mud crabs living in estuaries and mangrove ecosystems. It is commonly prepared in a variety of traditional Filipino
            dishes, where its roe (aligue) is a delicacy. The commercial demand for talangka is high, particularly during special occasions and holidays, when its rich flavor makes it a popular choice for festive meals. In the seafood market,
            talangka is sold both live and cooked, and it plays a crucial role in the local economy, especially in regions where crab farming is a significant industry.
