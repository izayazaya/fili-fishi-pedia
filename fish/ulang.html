            The ulang is found in freshwater rivers, lakes, and ponds across the Philippines, particularly in the provinces of Palawan, Cebu, and Davao. It is commonly found in both wild and farmed environments, with aquaculture being a growing
            industry for this species.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            The ulang is highly prized in Philippine cuisine, particularly for its sweet, tender meat. It is commercially farmed and harvested from both natural habitats and aquaculture facilities. The shrimp is commonly sold fresh, frozen, or even
            dried, and is often used in a variety of dishes such as soups, stews, and grilled preparations. Due to its popularity and high market demand, especially during the festive seasons, the ulang is an important economic resource for local
            communities, contributing to both domestic consumption and export markets. The farming of ulang, particularly in controlled freshwater ponds, has become increasingly efficient, ensuring steady supply to meet demand while promoting
            sustainable aquaculture practices.
