            Diwal is typically found in the shallow, muddy coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in areas such as the coastal regions of Sorsogon, Leyte, and Samar. It burrows in the soft mud of sandy or muddy seabeds and is commonly
            harvested by local fishers.

            Diwal is a delicacy in the Philippines, prized for its tender and sweet flesh. It is often harvested in the wild, and because of its unique appearance and flavor, it holds cultural and culinary significance. The soft, tube-like body of
            the diwal is eaten raw, grilled, or used in various Filipino dishes like soups, stews, and seafood salads. Its rarity and labor-intensive harvesting process contribute to its high market value. Diwal is also popular among seafood lovers
            due to its unique texture, which is compared to that of a soft, mild shellfish. During its peak season, it is a sought-after treat in local markets and high-end restaurants, where it adds an exotic touch to seafood menus.
