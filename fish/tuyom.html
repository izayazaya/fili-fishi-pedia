          <p class="desc">Tuyom is found in shallow coastal waters, typically around coral reefs, sandy bottoms, and seagrass beds. It is widely distributed throughout the Philippines, particularly in regions such as Palawan, Cebu, and Bohol.</p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Tuyom is valued for its local consumption and is often caught in large quantities using traditional fishing methods. It is usually sold fresh or dried and is a popular ingredient in Filipino cuisine, especially in soups,
            stews, and other seafood dishes. Though not as widely known internationally, it holds significance in the local markets, contributing to the fishing industry's economy in the coastal areas of the Philippines. Its small size makes it
            accessible for everyday meals, and it is favored for its delicate flavor.
