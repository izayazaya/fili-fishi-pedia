          <p class="desc">
            Tahong is a commercially important shellfish in the Philippines, both as a food source and for its role in aquaculture. Mussels are widely cultivated on farms in regions with suitable water conditions, where they grow quickly in the
            nutrient-rich waters. The shells are harvested, cleaned, and often sold fresh, frozen, or in processed forms like canned mussels. In addition to their culinary uses, mussels are valued for their health benefits, rich in protein, vitamins,
            and minerals. The shellfish is integral to the local economy, particularly in coastal communities, where it provides income for fishermen and contributes to the seafood industry's supply chain.
