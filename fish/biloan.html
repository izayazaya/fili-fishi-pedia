            Biloan is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in regions with rich plankton resources, such as near bays, estuaries, and coastal areas. It is abundant in both shallow and deeper waters, and is widely distributed
            across the archipelago, including areas in the Visayan and Mindanao seas.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            The Biloan is commercially important in the Philippines due to its use in various food products and as a key ingredient in traditional Filipino dishes. It is primarily caught for its meat, which is often sold fresh, dried, or salted. The
            fish is commonly used in the preparation of bagoong (fermented fish paste) and alamang (fermented shrimp paste), as well as in soups, stews, and grilling. Its high availability and low cost make it a popular choice for local markets. The
            Biloan also supports small-scale fishermen and contributes to the Philippine seafood industry, particularly in areas where other fish resources are limited. The fishâ€™s role in both local consumption and export contributes to the economic
            livelihood of coastal communities across the country.
