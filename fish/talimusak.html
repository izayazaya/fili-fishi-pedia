            The Talimusak fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in regions such as the Visayas and Mindanao. It is commonly found in deeper waters, though it also moves closer to the shore during breeding seasons.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Talimusak fish is valued for its long, slender body and tender, white flesh. It is commonly used in Filipino cuisine for dishes like sinigang (sour soup), adobo, and grilled preparations. Talimusak is also often dried or
            salted for preservation, making it a popular option in coastal areas where it is caught. The fish’s mild flavor and versatility make it a favorite among local consumers, especially in coastal communities. It is caught by small-scale
            fishermen and widely available in markets throughout the Philippines. Due to its affordability and availability, Talimusak plays an important role in supporting the livelihoods of local fishers. It is also sometimes exported to other
            countries with large Filipino populations, contributing to the Philippine seafood industry.
