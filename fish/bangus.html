            Bangus is widely distributed across the Philippines, particularly in coastal areas, brackish water lakes, and river estuaries. It is commonly farmed in bangus (milkfish) ponds, especially in regions like Pangasinan, Taal, and parts of
            Mindanao. Wild populations are also found in the coastal waters of the country.

          <p class="desc">
            The Bangus is one of the most commercially important fish in the Philippines, contributing significantly to the countryâ€™s fishing industry. It is a staple in Filipino cuisine, known for its tender white meat and slightly fatty texture,
            making it a favorite for grilling, frying, and cooking in stews like sinigang. Bangus is also processed into various products such as canned goods, salted fish, and smoked milkfish. The fish is not only caught in the wild but also
            extensively farmed, with the aquaculture industry playing a key role in ensuring a steady supply. The large-scale production of Bangus supports thousands of jobs in both fishing and processing sectors, providing a vital source of
            livelihood for many communities. Its popularity both in local and international markets makes it a crucial part of the Philippine seafood trade.
