            The Tulingan fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It is a migratory species that is commonly found in offshore waters and is often caught by commercial fishing
            boats using trolling and long-line methods.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Tulingan is highly valued for its firm, meaty flesh and is a popular fish in Filipino cuisine. It is often used in dishes like sinigang (sour soup), kilawin (raw fish marinated in vinegar), and paksiw (fish cooked in
            vinegar). Tulingan is also commonly canned or preserved through smoking, drying, or salting for longer shelf life. It is sold fresh in local markets and is especially popular in coastal provinces where it is abundant. The fish is not as
            widely known as other tuna species but has a strong demand in the local market due to its affordability and versatility in cooking. The Tulingan fish is also an important export product, contributing to the Philippine fishing industry.
            Sustainable management of Tulingan fisheries is necessary to prevent overfishing and ensure the long-term viability of the species in the wild.
