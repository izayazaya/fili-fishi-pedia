            Ludong is typically found in coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in muddy or sandy bottoms near river mouths and estuaries. It is common in areas such as the northern parts of Luzon, particularly in Cagayan Valley, and other
            coastal regions.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Ludong fish is highly prized due to its delicate flavor and tender meat. It is considered a specialty fish, especially in northern Luzon, where it is often cooked in sinigang (sour soup) or grilled. Due to its limited
            availability, Ludong is considered a delicacy and can command higher prices in local markets. The fish is also popular during special occasions and is sought after by tourists looking for unique culinary experiences. Although not as
            widely distributed as other fish, Ludong plays a vital role in the local fishing industry and is an important part of the cultural food heritage in certain regions of the Philippines.
