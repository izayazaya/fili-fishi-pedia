            The Babansi is commonly found in the shallow coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in regions with mangroves, estuaries, and near coral reefs. It is distributed across various parts of the Philippines, including the Visayan Sea,
            Sulu Sea, and coastal areas of Mindanao.

            The Babansi plays an important role in the commercial fishing industry in the Philippines. It is often caught in large numbers and is highly valued for its use in making fermented fish products like bagoong (fish paste) and alamang
            (fermented shrimp paste). It is also sold fresh in local markets, where it is used in traditional Filipino dishes, including soups and stews. The fish's small size and abundance make it a cost-effective and readily available source of
            protein for many Filipino households. The Babansi supports the livelihoods of many small-scale fishermen and contributes to the broader seafood industry. Additionally, it is increasingly exported as part of the growing demand for Filipino
            seafood products. Its culinary versatility and role in both local consumption and trade make it an important fish commercially in the Philippines.
