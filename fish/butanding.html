          <p class="desc">Butanding can be found in the shallow, coastal waters of the Philippines, especially in areas with coral reefs and mangrove ecosystems. They thrive in regions with warm water and are often located near fishing villages.</p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Butanding is a notable catch for local fishermen, valued for its taste and nutritional content. It is a popular fish in Filipino cuisine, often served fresh or dried. Due to its availability in coastal areas, it plays an
            important role in supporting local livelihoods and is typically sold in markets for a modest price. Its flesh is tender, making it a preferred choice for a variety of dishes, from grilled fish to stews. Furthermore, its commercial
            availability supports small-scale fisheries and the broader seafood industry in the Philippines, contributing to food security and local economies.
