            Igat is commonly found in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, and ponds across the Philippines. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and can be found in areas with abundant aquatic vegetation. It is widely distributed in the
            country, especially in regions like Luzon, Mindanao, and Visayas, where freshwater environments are abundant.

            Igat (Channa micropeltes) is a popular fish in the Philippines, particularly in rural areas where it is caught and farmed in freshwater ponds. It is known for its firm, white flesh and is often used in various Filipino dishes, such as
            sinigang (sour soup) and inihaw na igat (grilled snakehead). The fish is also valued for its versatility, often being cooked in soups, stews, or fried. Igat is commonly caught through traditional fishing methods or raised in controlled
            aquaculture systems. Its availability in both fresh and processed forms, such as smoked or dried, makes it a staple in many households. Despite its popularity, there are concerns about its invasive nature, as it can disrupt local
            ecosystems. Nevertheless, igat remains an important source of protein for Filipino communities and contributes to both local consumption and small-scale commercial fishing.
