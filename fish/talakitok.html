            The Talakitok fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, especially in the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It is commonly found in near-shore areas, including coral reefs and coastal habitats, where it forms schools
            and thrives in warm, tropical waters.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Talakitok fish is highly valued in the Philippines due to its firm, flavorful meat and versatility in cooking. It is widely used in Filipino dishes such as sinigang (sour soup), grilled talakitok, paksiw (fish cooked in
            vinegar), and escabeche (sweet and sour fish). It is often sold fresh in local markets, but it is also commonly preserved by drying, smoking, or salting. Talakitok is especially popular in coastal communities, where it is a staple food.
            The fish is commercially important to both local consumption and small-scale fisheries, contributing significantly to the livelihoods of fishermen. Additionally, Talakitok is exported to other countries, further boosting its commercial
            value. The fish's mild flavor, tender flesh, and versatility make it a popular choice for various cooking methods, maintaining its strong demand in both domestic and international seafood markets.
