            Espada (swordfish) is found in the deep, open waters of the Philippines, particularly in the Pacific Ocean and around offshore islands. It is a migratory species and can be found in both temperate and tropical waters. Swordfish are
            commonly spotted in the waters of the Visayan Sea, the Sulu Sea, and near the coasts of Luzon and Mindanao.

          <p class="desc">
            Espada (Xiphias gladius) is a highly prized commercial fish in the Philippines due to its large size, firm, meaty flesh, and excellent flavor. Swordfish is considered a luxury item and is often served in upscale restaurants, particularly
            in grilled, steak-like portions. It is popular for its rich, slightly sweet taste and dense texture, making it ideal for grilling, searing, or baking. Swordfish is typically caught by large commercial fishing vessels using longlines or
            harpoons, and its availability can fluctuate depending on migratory patterns. The fish is sold fresh, frozen, or as steaks in local markets, and there is also a significant demand for its export to international markets. Swordfish plays a
            major role in the fishing economy of the Philippines, supporting both local markets and international seafood trade. Sustainable fishing practices are encouraged to ensure the long-term availability of this valuable species.
