            Banagan, or ribbonfish, is found in both coastal and offshore waters throughout the Philippines, particularly in regions such as the Visayan Sea, Sulu Sea, and around Palawan. It prefers deeper waters but can also be found near the
            surface at certain times.

          <p class="desc">
            Banagan, or ribbonfish, is an important catch in Philippine fisheries, prized for its long, slender body and tender meat. It is typically used for grilling, frying, or in soups and stews. Ribbonfish is often sold fresh in local markets,
            but it is also processed into dried fish for preservation and export. While not as commercially dominant as other fish species, Banagan is valued in coastal communities and contributes to the livelihoods of small-scale fishers. The fish
            is known for its mild flavor and is popular in local cuisine, particularly in dishes that highlight its texture. Sustainable harvesting practices are encouraged, as the species plays a role in the marine food web and supports local
            economies.
