            The Tilapia fish is widely distributed across the Philippines, thriving in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and rivers. It is commonly farmed in various provinces like Pangasinan, Batangas, and parts of Mindanao, where
            aquaculture practices support its production.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Tilapia fish is one of the most important and widely consumed fish in the Philippines. It is valued for its mild taste, affordable price, and versatility in cooking. Tilapia is used in a variety of Filipino dishes such
            as sinigang (sour soup), paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar), and grilled tilapia. It is commonly sold fresh, but is also available in processed forms such as frozen, filleted, or smoked. The fish is a staple in Filipino households due to its
            accessibility and nutritional value. Tilapia farming has grown significantly in the Philippines, and the fish is exported to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, and the Middle East. The industry provides income
            for many farmers and fishermen, contributing to the local economy. Despite challenges like overfarming and environmental issues, tilapia remains a crucial part of the Philippine aquaculture sector.
