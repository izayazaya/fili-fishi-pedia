            Hito is commonly found in freshwater habitats throughout the Philippines, particularly in rivers, ponds, and lakes. It is widely distributed across the country, including regions like Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Hito thrives in
            slow-moving waters, mud-bottomed areas, and sometimes in brackish waters near coastal regions.

            Hito (Clarias batrachus) is a commercially important fish in the Philippines, known for its soft, white flesh and versatility in cooking. It is often farmed in freshwater fishponds and raised in controlled environments, making it a
            sustainable source of protein. Hito is popular in Filipino cuisine, where it is commonly used in dishes such as sinigang na hito (catfish in sour soup), crispy hito, or grilled preparations. The fish is prized for its affordability and
            mild flavor, making it a staple in many households, particularly in rural areas. It is typically sold fresh in local markets but can also be found in processed forms such as dried or smoked catfish. Due to its wide availability and low
            cost, Hito plays a significant role in both local markets and small-scale aquaculture, supporting the livelihoods of Filipino fish farmers.
