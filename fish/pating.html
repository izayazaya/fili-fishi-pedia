            Sharks, or Pating, are found throughout the Philippine archipelago, especially in coastal waters, reefs, and open seas. They are commonly found in areas like Palawan, Mindanao, and the Visayas, with certain species migrating between
            shallow and deep waters. Notable species in the region include the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus), and the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest shark species.

            Sharks, or Pating, are an important species in the Philippines for both the fishing industry and eco-tourism, though they face conservation challenges. Commercially, shark fishing has been a traditional practice, and their meat is used in
            various Filipino dishes such as pating na tinola (shark soup) and kilawing pating (shark ceviche). Shark fins are also highly prized in the global market, especially for shark fin soup, a delicacy in some Asian countries. The skin and
            cartilage of sharks are used in the leather and health supplement industries. However, due to overfishing and unsustainable practices, many shark populations have declined, leading to growing efforts for their protection and conservation.
            In response, sustainable shark fishing and conservation efforts are becoming more prominent. The Philippine government has implemented regulations to protect endangered species like the whale shark, and eco-tourism ventures, such as whale
            shark watching in places like Donsol, have become increasingly popular. These practices offer an alternative source of income for local communities while promoting shark conservation. Despite these efforts, the challenge remains to
            balance commercial use with the long-term sustainability of shark populations, ensuring that this important species remains in the Philippines' waters for future generations.
