          <p class="desc">The Malasugi fish is found in the open waters of the Philippines, particularly in coastal areas such as the Visayas, Mindanao, and Luzon. It is commonly found in deep waters near offshore reefs, drop-offs, and islands.</p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Malasugi fish is highly valued for its vibrant colors, firm texture, and rich flavor. It is popular in local markets and restaurants and is often used in grilling, frying, or making dishes like sinigang (sour soup) and
            kinilaw (raw fish salad). Known for its mild, sweet taste, the fish is especially sought after in both local and international markets. Malasugi is commonly sold fresh or frozen and is one of the more commercially significant fish species
            in the Philippine fishing industry. It is also important for the export market, with the fish being shipped to other countries due to its popularity as a sought-after food source. Additionally, the fish’s fast growth and wide distribution
            make it a key species for commercial fishing and sustainable fish farming operations in the country.
