            The kuhol is widely distributed in various parts of the Philippines, particularly in freshwater habitats such as rice fields, ponds, and marshes. It thrives in areas with slow-moving water, often in provinces with extensive agricultural
            activities.

          <p class="desc">
            The kuhol, or apple snail, is a popular delicacy in Filipino cuisine, particularly in provinces like Pampanga and Cavite. It is harvested from rice paddies and freshwater habitats, where it is often found in large numbers. The snail is
            known for its firm texture and mild, slightly sweet flavor, making it ideal for various traditional dishes such as kohol sa gata (snails cooked in coconut milk). While its primary use is in local culinary traditions, the kuhol is also a
            subject of interest in ecological studies due to its impact on rice farming, where its feeding behavior can damage crops. Despite this, it remains an important source of food and livelihood in rural communities.
