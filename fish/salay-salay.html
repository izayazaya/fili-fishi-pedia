            The Salay-salay fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, especially around the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It is commonly found near coral reefs, sandy bottoms, and in shallow, warm coastal areas.

            Commercially, the Salay-salay (Mackerel Scad) is a popular fish in the Philippines due to its affordability, mild flavor, and firm flesh. It is commonly used in local dishes such as tinola (a type of soup), sinigang (sour soup), or
            grilled preparations. It is also used in paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar) and is often seen in dried or salted forms for preservation. Salay-salay plays an important role in the Philippine fishing industry, particularly for small-scale
            fishermen who catch it in large quantities. The fish is widely available in local markets and is considered a staple in many Filipino households. Its availability and versatility make it an important commodity in both domestic and
            international markets, where it is exported to meet the demand for affordable and nutritious fish.
