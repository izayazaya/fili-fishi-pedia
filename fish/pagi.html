          The Pagi is a common name for a type of stingray found in the waters of the Philippines. It is a marine species that inhabits shallow coastal areas and estuaries. These fish are known for their wide, flat bodies and long, whip-like tails,
          which often contain venomous spines. Pagi are typically found in the muddy or sandy bottoms of bays and river mouths.

            The Pagi can be found in coastal regions across the Philippines, particularly in the Visayas and Mindanao areas. It is commonly seen in shallow waters like bays, estuaries, and river mouths, where it feeds on benthic organisms.

          <p class="desc">
            In the Philippines, the Pagi is not only a significant part of the local marine ecosystem but also an important species in the fishing industry. Although not as widely consumed as other fish, it is sometimes sold in local markets and is
            prized for its unique flavor and texture. The meat of the Pagi is used in various dishes, and its skin is sometimes utilized for leather production. The stingray is often caught using traditional fishing methods and is typically prepared
            by grilling, frying, or stewing. Despite its venomous spines, which pose a risk to fishermen, the Pagi remains a valuable catch, especially in certain coastal communities where it is considered a delicacy.
