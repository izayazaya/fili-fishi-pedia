        <p class="desc">The Dikya (also known as "Box jellyfish") is a highly venomous species of jellyfish found in the waters of the Philippines. It is known for its potent sting that can be fatal to humans.</p>

          <p class="desc">
            The Dikya is typically found in coastal waters, particularly in the tropical regions around the Philippines, including areas like Palawan, Mindanao, and the Visayas. They are often seen in shallow waters near the shore but can be found
            deeper as well.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            The Dikya is not commonly fished for food due to its dangerous venom, but it is of interest for scientific research, particularly in the field of marine biology and toxicology. In some areas, parts of the jellyfish may be used in
            traditional medicine or even as a delicacy, though the risks of handling the species are considerable. Their venomous properties make them a subject of caution for locals and tourists. The jellyfish's potential uses in biomedical research
            are being explored, focusing on its venom components and how they could aid in the development of new treatments for various medical conditions.
