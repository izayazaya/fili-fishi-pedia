            The Bisugo is commonly found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in shallow and deeper areas near reefs, sandy bottoms, and offshore islands. It is distributed throughout the archipelago, including the Visayan Sea, Sulu
            Sea, and other coastal regions.

          <p class="desc">
            The Bisugo is commercially important in the Philippine fishing industry due to its high demand and versatile culinary uses. Known for its delicate, mild flavor and tender white meat, Bisugo is often grilled, fried, or used in soups and
            stews like sinigang. It is also processed for export, including fresh, dried, and frozen forms. The fish is popular in Filipino households and restaurants, contributing significantly to local markets, especially in coastal communities
            where it supports small-scale fisheries. With its relatively high market value, Bisugo is also a favored choice for export, bringing economic benefits to the Philippine seafood industry. Its abundance and demand make it a key fish species
            commercially, supporting both domestic consumption and the country’s international seafood trade.
