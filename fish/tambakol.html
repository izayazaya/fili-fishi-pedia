            The Tambakol fish is found in the deep waters of the Philippines, especially in regions like the Sulu Sea, Bohol Sea, and along the western and eastern coasts of the country. It is commonly caught by commercial and artisanal fishermen
            using longlines or purse seines.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Tambakol fish is highly prized for its firm, rich meat and is a key player in the Philippine tuna industry. It is widely consumed both locally and internationally, particularly in the form of sashimi, sushi, or canned
            tuna. The fish is often exported to countries like Japan, the United States, and other parts of Southeast Asia, where it holds high market value. In the Philippines, Tambakol is also enjoyed fresh in dishes like sinigang (sour soup) or
            grilled. The commercial tuna industry, particularly in Mindanao and other coastal regions, supports many fishermen and processing plants. Tambakol's export contributes significantly to the Philippine economy, making it one of the
            country's most commercially valuable marine species. Due to its popularity and demand, sustainable fishing practices are increasingly emphasized to ensure the long-term viability of the fishery.
