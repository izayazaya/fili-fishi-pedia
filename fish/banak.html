            Banak is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, often in estuaries, rivers, and brackish water areas. It is distributed throughout the Philippine archipelago, particularly in areas with mangroves and muddy or sandy bottoms where
            it feeds on algae and small organisms.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Banak is an important species in the Philippine fishing industry. It is caught in large quantities, both for local consumption and export. The fish is known for its firm and mildly flavored meat, which is highly valued in
            Filipino cuisine. It is commonly used in dishes like sinigang (sour soup), grilled, or dried for preservation. Banak is also popular in making fish-based products, such as fish paste. Its versatility and the demand for it in local markets
            make it an important fish for small-scale and commercial fisheries. The availability of Banak in Philippine waters supports the livelihoods of many fishermen and contributes to the local seafood economy, while also being a readily
            accessible source of protein for Filipino families.
