            Asohos is abundant in the coastal waters of the Philippines, especially in regions with abundant plankton and in shallow areas near estuaries, bays, and mangroves. It thrives in areas with clear, warm waters and is commonly found in the
            Visayan Sea, the Sulu Sea, and other coastal regions.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Asohos is highly valued in the Philippines, particularly in the production of fish products like bagoong (fermented fish paste) and alamang (fermented shrimp paste). It is also consumed fresh or dried, often used as a
            seasoning in various Filipino dishes such as sinigang and adobo. Due to its small size and abundance, Asohos is typically caught in large quantities, making it a staple in both local markets and regional exports. The fish plays a key role
            in supporting small-scale fisheries and provides a source of livelihood for coastal communities. Its versatility and importance in Filipino cuisine make it a significant commercial species, especially in the southern parts of the country.
