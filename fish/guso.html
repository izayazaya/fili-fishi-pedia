          <p class="desc">Guso can be found along the coastal regions of the Philippines, especially in the provinces of Sorsogon, Davao, and Zamboanga. It thrives in shallow, warm waters, particularly in areas where there are coral reefs.</p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Guso is considered a valuable marine resource, particularly in the Philippines, where it is harvested and sold as a culinary delicacy. It is often cultivated in sea farms to meet growing demand both locally and
            internationally. The algae is sought after for its mild, slightly salty flavor and is used in a variety of dishes. Additionally, it is valued for its nutritional content, being rich in fiber, minerals, and vitamins, making it a healthy
            ingredient in Filipino cuisine. Guso is also exported in dried or processed forms for international markets. With its growing popularity, the industry surrounding guso farming and harvesting has seen an increase, contributing to the
            livelihoods of coastal communities.
