            The Malakapas fish is found in coastal waters and shallow reefs around the Philippines, particularly in areas like the Visayas, Mindanao, and some parts of Luzon. It prefers warmer waters and is commonly spotted near coral reefs,
            estuaries, and river mouths.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Malakapas (Blacktip Shark) is not as widely consumed as other fish species, but it is prized in certain regions of the Philippines. Its meat is used in various traditional dishes such as sinampalukang malakapas (shark
            soup) or simply grilled or fried. While the shark's flesh is consumed locally, its fins are also used in the international market for shark fin soup, which can make the fish a valuable commodity for fishermen. However, due to
            sustainability concerns and regulations surrounding shark populations, the fishing of Malakapas is often regulated. Despite this, the fish remains important in local economies, supporting coastal communities where shark fishing is a key
            activity.
