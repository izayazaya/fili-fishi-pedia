            The Taksay fish is commonly found in the brackish waters of rivers, lakes, and estuaries in the Philippines. It is particularly abundant in regions such as Luzon, especially around Manila Bay and other coastal areas in the country.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Taksay fish is valued for its firm, white flesh and mild flavor. It is commonly used in local Filipino dishes, including sinigang (sour soup), sotanghon (noodle soup), and paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar). Taksay is also
            often smoked or salted for preservation, and its dried form is popular in some coastal regions. Due to its relatively low cost and widespread availability, it is a staple in many Filipino households. Small-scale fishermen often catch
            Taksay, and it plays a role in supporting the livelihoods of local fishing communities. The fish is also available in local markets and contributes to the local seafood trade. Although it is not as commercially significant as some other
            species, Taksay remains an important part of the Philippine fishing industry, especially in coastal and riverine areas.
