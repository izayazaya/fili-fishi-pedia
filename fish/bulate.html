            The Snake Mackerel is found in deep, warm waters around the Philippines, particularly in the Visayan Sea, the Sulu Sea, and other coastal waters where they migrate for feeding and spawning. They are typically captured at depths ranging
            from 200 to 500 meters.

            The Snake Mackerel, also known locally as Bulate, is not as commercially prominent as other fish species in the Philippines, but it still holds some importance in local fisheries. The fish is valued for its firm, white flesh, which is
            commonly processed into fillets or used in various Filipino dishes, often grilled or dried. Due to its relatively high fat content, the fish tends to have a strong, sometimes pungent flavor, which some people find less desirable. However,
            it is often preferred for its high nutritional value, especially its omega-3 fatty acids. It is sometimes exported or sold in markets catering to specific culinary tastes.
