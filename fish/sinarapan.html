            The Sinarapan fish is found in the freshwater lakes of the Philippines, particularly in Lake Buhi in the Bicol region, which is the only place where it is found in abundance. It thrives in shallow, clear, and cool waters.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Sinarapan fish is considered a delicacy due to its tiny size and distinct taste. Because of its small size, it is often caught in large quantities using fine nets. Sinarapan is most commonly consumed fresh or salted, and
            it is a key ingredient in local dishes such as sinarapan na ginataan (cooked in coconut milk). It is also traditionally preserved by drying and salting, which makes it popular as a dried snack. Despite its small size, the Sinarapan is
            economically important to the local communities around Lake Buhi, where it is a significant source of income for small-scale fishermen. Its commercial value is also evident in the tourism industry, as many people visit the area
            specifically to enjoy dishes made from this unique fish. While it is primarily consumed within the Philippines, there is also some local demand for export, further contributing to its commercial significance.
