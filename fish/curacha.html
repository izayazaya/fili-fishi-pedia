            Curacha is predominantly found in the coastal waters of the Zamboanga Peninsula, especially in the areas surrounding the Basilan Strait. It can also be found in other parts of the Sulu Sea, where its habitat in rocky, deep waters provides
            ideal conditions for the species.

          <p class="desc">
            Curacha is a sought-after seafood in the Philippines, valued for its tender and flavorful meat. The spanner crab is often served in specialty restaurants, typically in a rich garlic butter sauce or grilled to perfection. This crustacean
            is typically harvested using traps or nets, ensuring a sustainable supply of this premium product. Although curacha is found in many coastal regions, it is most abundant in the southern parts of the country, particularly in the Zamboanga
            Peninsula. The commercial demand for curacha continues to grow, driven by its culinary appeal and the increasing interest in exotic, high-quality seafood both locally and internationally.
