            Dilis is found in both coastal and offshore waters throughout the Philippines, particularly in regions near the Visayan Sea, Sulu Sea, and along the shores of Luzon and Mindanao. It thrives in shallow, inshore waters, often near estuaries
            or mangrove areas, where it forms large schools.

            Dilis (Stolephorus spp.) is a small but commercially significant fish in the Philippines, valued for its delicate, flavorful flesh and its versatility in Filipino cuisine. It is commonly dried, salted, or canned, making it a popular snack
            or side dish. Dilis is typically used in various dishes, such as "dried dilis" served with vinegar and garlic, or included in stews and soups. It is harvested using small boats, nets, or seines, often in large quantities. Due to its
            affordability, it is a common source of protein for local communities and is widely available in markets across the country. Dilis also plays a role in the export market, particularly in the form of dried or salted anchovies, reaching
            international markets in places with Filipino diaspora communities. The fish's small size and high availability ensure its continued prominence in the local food industry.
