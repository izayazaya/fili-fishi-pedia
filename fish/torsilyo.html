            The Torsilyo fish is found in coastal waters across the Philippines, particularly in the Visayas, Mindanao, and Luzon. It thrives in warm, tropical waters and is commonly found in schools near the surface of bays and estuaries.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Torsilyo fish is widely consumed due to its abundance and low cost. It is typically used in local Filipino dishes such as sardinas (sardines in tomato sauce), sinigang (sour soup), and paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar).
            Torsilyo is also preserved through drying, salting, or smoking, and dried Torsilyo is often used as a snack or served with rice as a simple meal. This small fish is a significant part of the local diet and is particularly popular in
            coastal communities where it is readily available. Its affordability and nutritional value make it a staple in many Filipino households. The Torsilyo fish also plays an important role in the Philippine fishing industry, both for local
            consumption and for export to nearby countries. Sustainable fishing practices are essential to maintain the healthy population of this species in the wild, as overfishing can deplete their numbers.
