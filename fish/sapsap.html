            The Sapsap fish is found in the shallow, coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly in regions such as the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It is commonly found in sandy or muddy bottoms, near coral reefs, estuaries, and other
            coastal habitats.

          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Sapsap is a popular fish in the Philippines due to its mild, slightly sweet taste and soft, tender flesh. It is commonly used in local dishes like sinigang (sour soup), paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar), or grilled. Sapsap is
            often dried, salted, or smoked for preservation, especially in rural areas, making it a staple in many households. The fish is widely available in local markets, particularly in coastal regions, and is also an important part of the
            small-scale fishing industry. Due to its affordability and versatile culinary uses, Sapsap remains a highly consumed fish in the Philippines, supporting both local consumption and small-scale fisheries. Although it is not as commercially
            significant as some other species, Sapsap's role in the local seafood trade is crucial, contributing to the livelihood of many fishermen and fish vendors across the country.
