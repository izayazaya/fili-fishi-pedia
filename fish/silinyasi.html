            The Silinyasi fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, particularly around the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It is commonly found in shallow, coral-rich areas or seagrass beds, typically in tropical waters.

            Commercially, Silinyasi is highly valued for its tender, mildly sweet meat and is a popular fish in Filipino cuisine. It is commonly used in dishes such as sinigang (sour soup), paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar), or simply grilled. It is
            particularly famous when dried and salted, known as danggit, which is a beloved snack or breakfast food in the Philippines. Silinyasi is widely available in local markets, especially in coastal regions where it is often caught by
            small-scale fishermen. Its affordable price and versatility make it a staple in many Filipino households. Moreover, Silinyasi, especially in its dried form, has significant commercial value for export, especially to countries with large
            Filipino populations. Its commercial significance supports both the local and international seafood trade, making it an important species in the Philippine fishing industry.
