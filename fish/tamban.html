            The Tamban fish is found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, especially in regions like the Visayas, Mindanao, and parts of Luzon. It thrives in warm, tropical waters and is typically found in large schools near the surface of bays,
            estuaries, and reefs.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, the Tamban fish is widely consumed in the Philippines due to its affordability, versatility, and rich flavor. It is commonly used in Filipino dishes such as sardinas (sardines in tomato sauce), sinigang (sour soup), and
            paksiw (fish cooked in vinegar). Tamban is also often canned, smoked, salted, or dried for preservation, with dried tamban being a popular snack or breakfast food. It is an important fish for both small-scale and commercial fisheries in
            the country, supporting the livelihoods of many local fishermen. Tamban is not only a staple in Filipino households but is also exported to other countries, contributing to the Philippine seafood industry. Its relatively low cost and high
            availability make it a significant fish in the local and international market, further driving its demand and commercial importance.
