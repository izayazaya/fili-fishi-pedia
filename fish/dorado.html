            Dorado is found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Philippines, particularly in offshore areas and around coral reefs. It is often found in deep waters, though it can also be spotted near floating debris or seaweed mats, where it
            hunts for smaller fish. Dorado is widely distributed in the Philippines, especially in regions like the Visayan Sea, Sulu Sea, and the waters surrounding Luzon.

            Dorado (Coryphaena hippurus) is a commercially important fish in the Philippines, known for its vibrant color and fast growth. It is highly valued for its firm, white, and flavorful meat, making it a favorite for grilling, frying, and
            sashimi. The fishâ€™s popularity extends beyond local markets to international seafood exports, particularly in high-end restaurants. Dorado is commonly caught by commercial fishing boats using longlines and nets, and it can also be found
            in fish markets, both fresh and frozen. It is often sold at a premium due to its rich flavor and the fact that it is considered a sportfish in many countries. Efforts are made to ensure sustainable fishing practices for dorado, given its
            economic significance and demand in both local and global markets.
