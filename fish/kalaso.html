            Kalaso is found throughout the Philippines, particularly in coastal waters, and is commonly located in areas with rich marine ecosystems like the Visayan Sea and the Sulu Sea. It prefers deeper waters and is often found near reefs,
            drop-offs, or in open ocean areas.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Commercially, Kalaso is highly prized for its rich, flavorful, and oily meat, which makes it popular in both local and international markets. It is often sold fresh, frozen, or smoked and is commonly used in Filipino dishes such as
            grilled mackerel, kinilaw (raw fish salad), and tinola (a savory soup). Its firm texture and high oil content make it a favorite for grilling or smoking, which enhances its flavor. Kalaso is an important fish in the Philippine fishing
            industry, especially for export to neighboring countries, contributing to both local consumption and the country's seafood trade.
