            The Bidbid is commonly found in the coastal waters of the Philippines, especially in shallow, brackish areas such as mangroves, estuaries, and bays. It thrives in warm, tropical waters and is distributed across the archipelago,
            particularly in regions like the Visayan Sea, Mindanao, and surrounding areas.

          <p class="desc">
            The Bidbid is commercially significant due to its use in traditional Filipino dishes and its contribution to the fishery industry. It is often caught in large quantities and sold fresh, dried, or salted, primarily used in making bagoong
            (fermented fish paste) and alamang (fermented shrimp paste). The fish is also used in soups and stews, prized for its delicate flavor and small size, which makes it ideal for various preservation methods. Bidbid supports small-scale
            fisheries in coastal areas and provides a livelihood for many fishermen. Due to its high demand for both local consumption and export, particularly in fermented products, Bidbid plays an important role in the Filipino food industry. It is
            an accessible and cost-effective source of protein for local communities, contributing to food security and the Philippine seafood trade.
