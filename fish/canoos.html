            Canoos can be found in freshwater rivers, lakes, and reservoirs across the Philippines, particularly in provinces with abundant aquaculture industries. The fish is also farmed in various aquaculture facilities, making it widely available.

          <p class="desc">
            Canoos is a highly sought-after species in the Philippines due to its mild flavor and firm, white flesh. It is farmed in freshwater ponds and is popular in both local and export markets. The fish is often sold fresh, frozen, or processed
            into various food products such as fillets, fish steaks, and smoked fish. Canoos is particularly favored in Filipino cuisine, often used in dishes like sinigang (a sour soup) or grilled. It is also considered an affordable protein source,
            making it a staple in many households and restaurants. With the growing demand for aquaculture products, the production and commercial distribution of catfish have expanded, supporting both small-scale fishermen and large-scale farming
            operations across the country.
